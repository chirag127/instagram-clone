    *   The exact vulnerability you found.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Your environment (OS, browser, versions, etc.).
    *   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots.
3.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to provide a timeline for fixing the issue.
4.  We will not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been fixed and a patch is available.

## Security Best Practices

As a user of InstaFlow, please adhere to the following security best practices:

*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update your local development environment and any dependencies used with InstaFlow to their latest secure versions.
*   **Secure API Keys:** If InstaFlow or its components require API keys or secrets, store them securely and never commit them directly into your code repository. Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions.
*   **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize any user-provided input before processing it to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Follow Official Guidance:** Pay attention to official announcements and advisories from the InstaFlow project regarding security updates or best practices.

Thank you for helping to keep InstaFlow and its community secure!
